# expense-tracker

 The Expense Tracker project aims to provide users with a simple yet powerful tool to monitor and manage their daily spending habits. By tracking income and expenses, the application helps users gain insight into their financial behavior, identify areas for improvement, and make informed decisions about budgeting and saving.

The project involves building a user-friendly platform (web, mobile, or desktop) where users can:

Record income and expenses

Categorize transactions (e.g., food, transport, utilities)

View financial summaries through charts or reports

Set budgets and receive alerts when they are exceeded
